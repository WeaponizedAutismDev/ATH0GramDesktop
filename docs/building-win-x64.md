## Prepare folder

The build is done in **Visual Studio 2022** with **10.0.22000.0** SDK version.

Choose an empty folder for the future build, for example **D:\\TBuild**. It will be named ***BuildPath*** in the rest of this document. Create two folders there, ***BuildPath*\\ThirdParty** and ***BuildPath*\\Libraries**.

All commands (if not stated otherwise) will be launched from **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022.bat** (should be in **Start Menu > Visual Studio 2022** menu folder). Pay attention not to use any other Command Prompt.

## Install third party software

* Download **Python 3.10** installer from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it with adding to PATH.
* Download **Git** installer from [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and install it.

## Clone source code and prepare libraries

Open **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022.bat**, go to ***BuildPath*** and run

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/WeaponizedAutismDev/ATH0GramDesktop.git tdesktop
    tdesktop\Telegram\build\prepare\win.bat

You may encounter an error saying that your IP is not allowed - simply turn on VPN.

## Build the project

Go to ***BuildPath*\\tdesktop\\Telegram** and run

    configure.bat x64 -D TDESKTOP_API_ID=2040 -D TDESKTOP_API_HASH=b18441a1ff607e10a989891a5462e627

* Open ***BuildPath*\\tdesktop\\out\\Telegram.sln** in Visual Studio 2022
* Select Telegram project and press Build > Build Telegram (Debug and Release configurations)
* The result ATH0Gram.exe will be located in **D:\TBuild\tdesktop\out\Debug** (and **Release**)
